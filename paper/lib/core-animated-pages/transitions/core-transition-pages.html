`core-transition-pages` represents a page transition, which may include CSS and/or
script. It will look for a `core-style` element with the same `id` to install in the
scope of the `core-animated-pages` that's using the transition.

Example:

    <core-style id="fooTransition">
        // some CSS here
    </core-style>
    <core-transition-pages id="fooTransition"></core-transition-pages>

There are three stages to a page transition:

1. `prepare`: Called to set up the incoming and outgoing pages to the "before" state,
  e.g. setting the incoming page to `opacity: 0` for `cross-fade` or find and
  measure hero elements for `hero-transition`.

2. `go`: Called to run the transition. For CSS-based transitions, this generally
  applies a CSS `transition` property.

3. `complete`: Called when the elements are finished transitioning.

See the individual transition documentation for specific details.

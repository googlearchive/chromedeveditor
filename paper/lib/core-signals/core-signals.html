`core-signals` provides basic publish-subscribe functionality.

Note: avoid using `core-signals` whenever you can use
a controller (parent element) to mediate communication
instead.

To send a signal, fire a custom event of type `core-signal`, with
a detail object containing `name` and `data` fields.

    this.fire('core-signal', {name: 'hello', data: null});
    
To receive a signal, listen for `core-signal-<name>` event on a 
`core-signal` element.

  <core-signal on-core-signal-hello="{{helloSignal}}">

You can fire a signal event from anywhere, and all 
`core-signal` elements will receive the event, regardless
of where they are in DOM.

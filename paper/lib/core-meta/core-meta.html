`core-meta` provides a method of constructing a self-organizing database.
It is useful to collate element meta-data for things like catalogs and for 
designer.

Example, an element folder has a `metadata.html` file in it, that contains a 
`core-meta`, something like this:

    <core-meta id="my-element" label="My Element">
      <property name="color" value="blue"></property>
    </core-meta>

An application can import as many of these files as it wants, and then use 
`core-meta` again to access the collected data.

    <script src="core-meta.js"></script>

Use `byId(id)` to retrive a specific core-meta.

    <script src="core-meta-1.js"></script>

By default all meta-data are stored in a single databse.  If your meta-data 
have different types and want them to be stored separately, use `type` to 
differentiate them.

Example:

    <core-meta id="x-foo" type="xElt"></core-meta>
    <core-meta id="x-bar" type="xElt"></core-meta>
    <core-meta id="y-bar" type="yElt"></core-meta>

    <script src="core-meta-2.js"></script>

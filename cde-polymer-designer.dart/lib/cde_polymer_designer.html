  The `entryPoint` attribute can have the following values:
    - "local": use the locally stored sources for Polymer Designer; this is the
      faster option of the two, and it also works offline.
    - "online": use the official online Polymer Designer; this is slower, but
      provides the most up-to-date Polymer Designer UI. However, if the Designer
      code changes significantly, this option can result in a broken UI.

/**
 * spark-selection is a UI-less utility element to keep track of single- or
 * multi-item selection in a group of items. It is supposed to be instantiated
 * within an element that needs this functionality and used programmatically
 * via its Dart API.
 */
/**
 * Fired when tracked selection items change their selected state as a result
 * of a programmatic call to [select()], [toggle()] etc. For example:
 * with [multi] unset or false, when [select(B)] is called and item A is
 * currently selected, the `selected` event will fire for both 
 * A (isSelected==false) and B (isSelected==true).
 *
 * @event selected
 * @param {dynamic} detail['value'] the item that has changed its state
 * @param {bool} detail['isSelected'] the new selected state of the item
